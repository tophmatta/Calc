# Calc

This is a simple calculator that behaves a little differently
in that one uses the return function to store the first number
for the operation (E.g. 3 return 4 X -> 3 X 4)

Skills used:
- Converting between NSNumberFormatter, Strings, and Doubles
- More advanced use of Auto Layout
- Using get/set method
